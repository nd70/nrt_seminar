Getting Started
===============
Make sure that the required libraries are installed with python3:

    numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

You can install this globally on your system using pip or conda, e.g.:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

You can also install this inside of a virtual environment using `virtualenv`

    $ virtualenv --python=$(which python3) $HOME/nrt_seminar
    $ source $HOME/nrt_seminar/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

Once you have installed the dependencies, run `test.py` to make sure that the
libraries are correctly installed.
